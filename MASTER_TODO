build EC probe
# DONE

Complete basic resevoir system
  # Order materials
  Create skeleton Code 
    Solenoid pump
    Peristaltic pump
    Mixer
  Develop a design for the resevoir
    *The main thing that we need to reference is how the pump and the mixer will fit in the bottom of a standard 5 gallon bucket.
    * The EC probe needs to sit above the intake for the pump. Link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L54HB83/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_8?smid=A2PQGFJXAT8J9K&psc=1
    * The fertilizer resevoir and the distilled water resevoir need to sit above the EC probe.
  construct the shell
    We need to figure out what mixer we are going to use we have two options, a magnetic mixer or some modified blender
    Magnetic mixer would be preferred but we will need to do some testing with the o-scope to make sure that the magnet will not mess with the pump.
  Integrate the skeleton code together
  build the circuit
  Test the complete code
  Test the machine
  Make an animation of the complete project
