build EC probe
# DONE

Complete basic resevoir system
  # Order materials
  Create skeleton Code 
    Solenoid pump
    Peristaltic pump
    Mixer
  Develop a design for the resevoir
    *The main thing that we need to reference is how the pump and the mixer will fit in the bottom of a standard 5 gallon bucket.
    * The EC probe needs to sit above the intake for the pump. Link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L54HB83/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_8?smid=A2PQGFJXAT8J9K&psc=1
    * The fertilizer resevoir and the distilled water resevoir need to sit above the EC probe.
